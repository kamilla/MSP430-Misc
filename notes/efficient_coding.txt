The intrinsic function __even_in_range requires two parameters, the interrupt vector
register and the last value in the allowed range, which in this example is 10. The effect
of the intrinsic function is that the generated code can only handle even values within
the given range, which is exactly what is required in this case as the interrupt vector
register for Timer A can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. If the __even_in_range intrinsic

Avoid using large non-scalar types, such as structures, as parameters or return type. To save stack space, you should instead pass them as pointers or, in C++, as references.


The __noreturn keyword can be used on a function to inform the compiler that the
function will not return. If you use this keyword on such functions, the compiler can
optimize more efficiently. Examples of functions that do not return are abort and exit.
